Please download whole folder to play

You can also watch the introduction video for fun :)

Use the right stick to spawn a wheel of the soldiers and their info. 

To spawn the soldiers, use right stick + right bumper or the four face buttons on the corresponding positions.

If you want to use keyboards (which is just for testing):

Use WASD for red player movement, TFGH for playing soliders

Use up down left right for blue player movement, PL:" for playing soliders
